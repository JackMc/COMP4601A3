It's very hard to put into words how this movie makes me feel, because each and every time I watch it, I am swept away by how powerful and influential it is. Bigotry is an ever-growing boorishness in our society and young Americans are easily induced into believing that one sex or one race is better than the other. It is scary to think that one man alone can be responsible for such wide-spread hatred, but this movie only proves that you need but a few people of similar thinking to spread the word and build your biased militia. The story is told through the eyes of Derek Vinyard's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), an impressionable adolescent who idolizes his brother's power of persuasion and blindly consigns to his discriminatory views.

Derek (Edward Norton) has reasonable predisposed opinions of African-Americans: his firefighting father was murdered by one of them while sousing a blaze in an impoverished quarter of Venice Beach, California. From the immediate point of this personal tragedy, his vocation is to spread the belief that foreigners and ethnics are given more rights than hard-working, white Protestants and the solution is now in the hands of the victims: themselves. Thus under the headship of well-known white supremacist Cameron Alexander, Derek builds his legion of racist devotees, deftly christening his growing gang of disillusioned teens the "D.O.C.". The consequences of these beliefs take a powerful impact on his family when he guns down two Crips trying to steal his truck and is incarcerated for three years. During this time, his fledgling organization continues cultivating under the supervision of Cameron whilst Danny is swallowed into the chaos and adheres to Derek's corrupt ideals.

Through his junket in a maximum-security prison, his fellow inmate in the laundry happens to be a young black man interned for a false charge of assault. He breaks down the towering wall of stereotypes that surround his race, making Derek realize his beliefs were largely askew and that he had dissapatedly influenced many innocent people, more importantly his brother. As soon as he is paroled, he is on a mission to sway Danny from the neo-Nazi crew that he himself formulated and to unlearn the harmful ethics he so vigorously preached. This proves to be a difficult task as Danny has been completely conditioned by the fascist agenda of the D.O.C., posing a grueling solution: Derek must confront Cameron and confess to Danny the agonizing incident that induced his miraculous epiphany behind bars.
